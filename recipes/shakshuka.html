        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Shakshuka is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell 
            pepper, and garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast, but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots of 
            bread to mop up the sauce.
